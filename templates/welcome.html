			In this study, you are going to watch several online videos one by one. In each video (about 2-3 minute long), there is a speaker telling a story. The stories in those videos are more or less the same. While watching the videos, we ask you to pretend that you were in a teleconference with the speaker. Your task is trying to show you are very interested in what the speaker is telling you. In order to achieve that goal, you need provide feedback, such as head nod or "uh-hum", to the speaker while he or she is talking. You should be familiar with this kind of behavior when you talk with your good friends: you both provide such feedback (head nod or "uh-hum") to each other so that the conversation goes smoothly. However, in our study, we want you to press a button - the space bar on your keyboard, whenever you think it is a good time to give such response. We encourage you to give such feedback while pressing the space bar simultaneously so that you can be involved in the interaction as much as possible.
